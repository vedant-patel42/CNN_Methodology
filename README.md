# Title : Methodology Project: Convolutional Neural Network
## Abstract:
Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is a major breakthrough in the field of Deep Learning when we are dealing with  classification, detection and recognition problems where a model has to learn features from image data. While, Traditional Neural Network has poor performance and takes too much time to learn millions of pixels, CNN is an extension of NN which uses fewer parameters and gives better performance. This project covers motivation for using CNN,introduction to CNNâ€™s and illustrates its implementation by performing  image classification on CIFAR-10, a dataset of 60,000 32x32 RGB images. To understand the true potential of CNN, we perform a similar classification using another well known algorithm, random forest algorithm on the given dataset. Based on the result we achieved, CNN has far better training and testing accuracy as compared to the random forest algorithm.
